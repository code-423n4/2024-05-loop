[05/02/2024 05:36] mosharaf
Yeah.  Fix is applied


[05/02/2024 06:42] vikqaz
Can anyone please explain this point?

`Users that deposit LRTs get the correct amount assuming a favorable swap to ETH`


[05/02/2024 06:45] tenetloop
points are tracked by a backend


[05/02/2024 06:46] vikqaz
Publicly known issues:
`Crafting malicious calldata so that users get less funds as expected when claiming lpETH on LRT deposits (e.g. by setting big slippage/price impact)`

VS

Attack Ideas:
`Malicious 0x protocol calldata crafting by users to steal funds on claim`

It is bit confusing (for me)? What am I missing?


[05/02/2024 06:50] vikqaz
@Tenet


[05/02/2024 07:28] vikqaz
There is a 7 days gap between Epoch1 and Epoch2? or is it part of any one of these Epochs? @Tenet

Based on event emission?

[05/02/2024 07:51] 0xd4n1el
LRTs get swapped via 0x into ETH which is then converted to lpETH in the lpETH contract. The swap in 0x is assumed to be fair to the user since they check in the frontend the quoted values before submitting the tx


[05/02/2024 07:53] 0xd4n1el
So here we assume the frontend is not compromised in such a way users loose money because of slippage. The attack idea is to see if there is a way to a third party to submit calldata to steal users funds


[05/02/2024 07:54] 0xd4n1el
Yes, during the gap, deposits are locked and withdrawals allowed


[05/02/2024 07:55] 0xd4n1el
lpETH will be an ERC20 token, with conversion 1 to 1 to ETH. It is not rebasing or interest bearing unless you stake it


[05/02/2024 08:05] .justuzair
how can one check `claim` for erc20s?


[05/02/2024 08:05] .justuzair
we dont know what the bytes data will look like


[05/02/2024 09:06] davies_0212
Hi, @Tenet @0xd4n1el. Depositors, who locked `weETH, ezETH, rsETH, rswETH, uniETH, pufETH` not `ETH, WETH`, get `lpETH` by only 1 to 1 rate?


[05/02/2024 09:15] vahdrak1
In the previous audit report, WP-C1 meant critical?

So what does WP-I5 mean? invalid?
What about WP-N8?


[05/02/2024 09:26] 0xd4n1el
That's why there is data validation


[05/02/2024 09:27] 0xd4n1el
No, they get their LRT swapped to ETH first and then 1 to 1 conversion to lpETH


[05/02/2024 09:27] 0xd4n1el

@Tenet @0xd4n1el , are all issues in previous audits fixed?


[05/02/2024 09:28] 0xd4n1el
Yes


[05/02/2024 09:28] davies_0212
Got it. But, `ETH, WETH` lockers get `lpETH` not by 1 to 1. Right?


[05/02/2024 09:29] 0xd4n1el
They do get 1 to 1 conversion (up to maybe 1 wei precision)


[05/02/2024 09:32] davies_0212
Before converting all ETH to `lpETH`, no extra `lpETH` is added to `PrelaunchPoints`?


[05/02/2024 09:33] uaarrr
the functions with   `` onlyAfterDate(    startClaimDate    ) `` modifier can be executed only after 82 years ??


[05/02/2024 09:35] bbl4de.xyz
Check the `convertAllETH()` function it's updated there


[05/02/2024 09:35] uaarrr
i see this state variable setted  in constructor() , is there another place this state variable is modified with another value ?


[05/02/2024 09:36] 0xd4n1el
It is not intended, but it could happen


[05/02/2024 09:36] uaarrr
oh ok

Thanks.


[05/02/2024 09:49] davies_0212
@0xd4n1el Points is related to locking time?


[05/02/2024 09:50] 0xd4n1el
Yes, points are calculated in hourly basis on locked time


[05/02/2024 09:52] davies_0212
When could it happen?


[05/02/2024 09:53] davies_0212
And at that time, what about `WETH, weETH, ezETH, rsETH, rswETH, uniETH, pufETH`? I mean their rates after swap.


[05/02/2024 09:55] 0xd4n1el
ETH to lpETH is always 1 to 1, so rates are 1 to 1 after swap


[05/02/2024 09:55] .justuzair
no i mean I get the point, but how do you suppose we test it??


[05/02/2024 10:14] davies_0212
Before converting all ETH to lpETH, when could extra `lpETH` be added to `PrelaunchPoints`? And by whom?


[05/02/2024 10:48] 0xd4n1el
Someone could send lpETH directly to the contract, but not us


[05/02/2024 10:49] 0xd4n1el
You can see the hardhat tests to have an idea

[05/02/2024 11:29] davies_0212
Any users can mint `lpETH` directly, not through `PrelaunchPoints`?


[05/02/2024 11:32] 0xd4n1el
Yes


[05/02/2024 11:34] davies_0212
So, locking is only for points?


[05/02/2024 11:35] 0xd4n1el
Yes, and you commit your tokens to be converted to lpETH


[05/02/2024 12:42] davies_0212
Where can I see the function `UniswapV3Feature.sellTokenForEthToUniswapV3()`?


[05/02/2024 12:52] 0xd4n1el

@0xd4n1el What is the purpose of `totalSupply` and `totalLpETH` and what exactly should they track?


[05/03/2024 09:13] 0xfox_
@0xd4n1el 
I have a question regarding this section of the code4rena readme:
"After these 7 days the owner can call convertAllETH, that converts all ETH in the contract for lpETH. This conversion has the timestamp startClaimDate. The conversion for LRTs happens on each claim by using 0x API. This is triggered by each user."
Am i correct in my understanding that the ETH to lpETH conversion is initiated by the `PrelaunchPoints` owner and happens for all users while the deposited LRTs are converted to lpETH on an individual basis whenever a user makes a claim for lpETH?


[05/03/2024 09:38] 0xd4n1el
Probably will be an ERC4626 or something very similar


[05/03/2024 09:41] 0xd4n1el
totalSupply tracks all the ETH/WETH deposited and totalLpETH is the amount received after convertAllETH fort further lpETH distribution

{Reactions}
thankyou 

[05/03/2024 09:43] 0xd4n1el
Yes, that's it. Since there is no swap when converting lpETH to ETH, we decided to do all the conversion at once. On the other hand, for LRTs there is a swap, so to not take big slippage, we let the users do the swap (they set slippage parameters on the frontend) to ETH which then gets cnverted into lpETH

For the owner, can he call the convertAllETH function unlimited times?


[05/03/2024 12:34] bbl4de.xyz
No, it's protected with the onlyBeforeDate(startClaimDate) modifier and startClaimDate is set to block.timestamp during function execution, so it's impossible to call it again.

Hi @0xd4n1el , which case is that the user sent ETH to this contract ?


[05/03/2024 14:11] 0xd4n1el
Just by mistake, if a user sends ETH to the contract he looses it but we recover it and give it to other depositors


[05/03/2024 14:12] 0xd4n1el
Users should use the payable functions to deposit ETH


[05/03/2024 15:37] sathish9098kumar
Hi when deposit Weth the totalSupply increased . How this works when withdraw Weth ? because withdraw only checks token == ETH.


[05/03/2024 15:43] jaimegm_
When depositing WETH, the withdraw function within WETH is invoked (i.e. WETH.withdraw(_amount)). This will convert WETH into ETH and transfer it into PrelaunchPoints contract. So the contract will receive ETH

when user want to claim for another token except ETH u at first call 0x api for get path and another data?


[05/04/2024 09:08] 0xd4n1el
No, points are only based on locked tokens


[05/04/2024 09:09] 0xd4n1el
You can find 0x API docs easily, and percentage is just to claim a part of your lpETH when LRTs are deposited. Just in case you have big deposits and want to swap in several txs


[05/04/2024 09:10] 0xd4n1el
Yes, please check the hardhat tests on an example on this


[05/04/2024 09:10] pashap9990
tnx


[05/04/2024 11:06] pashap9990
can we have a private chat?


[05/04/2024 11:08] dyoff
Can you give us lpETH implementation


[05/04/2024 11:13] 0xd4n1el
Not yet because there will be another challenge for it. You should think about it as a wrapper 1 to 1 to ETH, like WETH


[05/04/2024 11:14] 0xd4n1el
You can create a private chat in this channel


[05/04/2024 11:14] 0xd4n1el
Please avoid PMs


[05/04/2024 13:04] wanziskata
there would be only one instance of this contract deployed, which would be done so by the protocol owners/devs, right?


[05/04/2024 14:43] 0xd4n1el
Yes, exactly

[05/05/2024 12:23] cholakovv
@0xd4n1el when loopActivation is set, this marks the end of the 1st epoch and when startClaimDate is set it marks the start of the 2nd epoch, right? and the gap is the 7 days where users cannot deposit and just withdraw


[05/05/2024 13:33] steadyman.
Can users only get points for locking their own tokens? Are there no other benefits when making a claim?


[05/05/2024 13:44] cholakovv
the user gets extra rewards when calling claimAndStake, bc they're staking their claimed lpETH into the Loop vault, but when calling claim() I don't think there is some extra reward or something, so the user just get lpETH, but @0xd4n1el can better confirm this


[05/05/2024 13:46] cholakovv
about this, what an user can do with his claimed lpETH if he decide not to stake?


[05/05/2024 15:51] bbl4de.xyz

[05/05/2024 21:04] 0xd4n1el
They get points by locking their tokens that will be transformed into an Aridrop later


[05/05/2024 21:05] 0xd4n1el
They just get the Airdrop, but their lpETH does not get extra rewards

{Reactions}
üëç 

[05/05/2024 21:05] 0xd4n1el
Via the Locked and Withdraw events, these should be reflectivg the correct information


[05/05/2024 21:24] 0xd4n1el
Those functions are external and permisionless, so anyone can call them


[05/05/2024 21:25] marshall1624
Did I understand correctly that one contract = 1 owner?


[05/05/2024 21:25] 0xd4n1el
There is only one contract and one owner


[05/05/2024 21:26] marshall1624
Okay, thank you


[05/05/2024 23:18] marshall1624
@0xd4n1el Can we assume that when the user deploys the contract, he will just send the tokens to the contract address?


[05/05/2024 23:19] 0xd4n1el
The contract is deployed only once


[05/05/2024 23:19] 0xd4n1el
And by us, not the users


[05/05/2024 23:21] 0xd4n1el
If they send ETH directly to the contract, they loose it (we give it to other users, or users can have it for free when claiming)


[05/05/2024 23:22] marshall1624
But if you deploy the contract, then msg.sender is set to your address, how can the user use the functions?


[05/06/2024 00:10] 4b69
@0xd4n1el in the recoverERC20 function how do you track how much erc20 tokens a user sent mistakenly to the protocol?


[05/06/2024 03:55] _karanel
If the token is in the allow list it cannot be withdrawn by the owner. Other tokens can be withdrawn. You can check which and how much erc20 tokens the contract holds through etherscan.


[05/06/2024 06:24] 0xd4n1el
Exactly


[05/06/2024 06:25] 0xd4n1el
Msg.sender is the address of the user that interacts with the contract


[05/06/2024 08:27] asui0944
Are lpETH and lpETHVault contracts created by loop protocol? and where can i get their addresses?


[05/06/2024 08:31] bbl4de.xyz
It's not in scope for this audit and we're not supposed to have their implementation as it's going to be another audit => https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/1234489629848240161/1236274578452647936


[05/06/2024 08:32] bbl4de.xyz
But d4n1el said we should treat the `deposit` function like deposit function for erc4626 vault


[05/06/2024 11:34] brandio
How does exchange proxy work? Does it just forward call data to the router or does it do some additional logic in the process?


[05/06/2024 11:36] gumgumzum
It looks for the contract to call based on the selector and forwards it entirely to that contract as far as I understand


[05/06/2024 11:37] brandio
Oh okay. Thanks


[05/06/2024 11:40] gumgumzum
In this case it's either the UniswapV3 or the TransformERC20 features


[05/06/2024 12:14] kirobrejka_80610
hi guys! These are supposed to be the whitelisted tokens right?

hi, did anyone manage to get the hardhat tests to pass? if so would you be so kind to share your config? i‚Äôm struggling on that part only the WETH test passes. thanks!!


[05/07/2024 04:33] p2m8
my issue is that for other tokens the exchange is going to be uniswap v3 but the selector returned is still the one for TRANSFORM


[05/07/2024 04:34] p2m8
also struggling to understand why the claim token is ETH in all cases in that test file although it should be WETH in case we use uniswap v3?


[05/07/2024 04:42] p2m8
like it works if I use data as transformERC20 data even when uniswapv3 is the only exchange, but I do not think this is the way it should be?


[05/07/2024 07:15] 0xd4n1el
We will use the selector as the reference to pass the data, so you can ignore the source parameter in the API response

{Reactions}
üëç 

[05/07/2024 07:18] 0xd4n1el
When you put ETH as output token on UniV3 0x adds an extra step to unwrap, that's why we pass ETH to the API call


[05/07/2024 07:18] 0xd4n1el
Depending on the selector, the encoded output token will be WETH or ETH though

{Reactions}
üëç 

[05/07/2024 10:03] p2m8
that‚Äôs very clear thank you very much


[05/07/2024 14:35] krisp6347
@0xd4n1el where does the bytes data come from for the 0x API? Do users need to prepare it themselves?


[05/07/2024 15:21] 0xd4n1el
We prepare it in our frontend

{Reactions}
üëç 

[05/07/2024 18:24] honour_d_dev
does the airdrop allocated to a user depend on the quantity of their lpETH? @0xd4n1el


[05/07/2024 20:59] 0xd4n1el
No, the airdrop depends on the locked amount as long as it is not withdrawed


[05/08/2024 10:08] vikqaz
My only point of concern is the implementation of lpETH token contract. Implementation of proper access controls, who is gonna be the owner a multisig or a single signer, because eventually all the ETHERS are swiftly transferred to the lpETH contract


[05/08/2024 10:10] mgnfy_view
Got anything so far anyone?


[05/08/2024 10:11] _karanel
I believe the lpETH and lpETHVault contracts will be in scope for the 2nd part of this audit in end of May


[05/08/2024 10:25] asui0944
can you please provide an example data(when calling claim func) or send link to the frontend that will prepare the data?


[05/08/2024 10:39] 0xd4n1el
You can check that on the hardhat tests


[05/08/2024 11:16] asui0944
when swap is done through fillQuote using exchange proxy, every token is always swapped to eth? in both uniswap and transformERC20?


[05/08/2024 11:28] honour_d_dev
Yeah


[05/08/2024 12:22] bbl4de.xyz
Yes although when going through uniswap it is first swapped to WETH and then unwrapped to ETH.

Hey, guys, when I try to run the "PrelaunchPoints0x.test.ts" script I get the follwoing error:  `WrongSelector("0x415565b0")`. If I comment out all the tokens, without WETH, the script works fine but throws this error for all of the other tokens


[05/08/2024 18:47] nfmelendez
the selector changes with the amount


[05/08/2024 18:47] nfmelendez
i mean the quote of 0x change the selector  for different range of amount


[05/08/2024 18:48] nfmelendez
try 100 of amount, and try 10000000 of amount, you will see


[05/08/2024 18:57] chonkov
You mean that the specified amount as a function argument will change the function selector(first 4 bytes)?

Hi im pretty curious about this line in _claim function.
```claimedAmount = userStake.mulDiv(totalLpETH, totalSupply);```
Why do we have to calculate the percentage and proportion of claimedAmount based on totalLpETH and totalSupply? Why don't we just use ```balances[msg.sender][_token]``` as a value to be transfered?


[05/09/2024 15:02] nave765
Thanks


[05/09/2024 15:31] paprikrumplikas
I think because ETH sent directly to the contract before claim goes live is distributed this way.

https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/1234489629848240161/1236820045728841871


[05/09/2024 16:42] nfmelendez
yes that line, what do you think about precision loss there. is in favor of the user or the protocol?


[05/09/2024 18:04] vikqaz

[05/10/2024 02:11] nave765
```claimedAmount = userStake.mulDiv(totalLpETH, totalSupply);```
based on the math utils in OZ, it require third parameter right for denominator. What will be the value if third parameter isn't filled in ?

`userStake`, `totalLpETH` and `totalSupply` are the 3 params

[05/28/2024 05:40] 0xsorrynotsorry
I have no idea tbh, it seems like it can anytime start PJQA


[05/28/2024 05:42] 0xumarkhatab
got it , it means all issues are evaluated already ?


[05/28/2024 05:42] parthmandale
@sorryNotsorry So now will that still be upgraded to H/M issue by judges?


[05/28/2024 05:43] 0xumarkhatab
maybe @alymurtazamemon would have his eyes on what amount of time will it take to announce the results ?


[05/28/2024 05:47] 0xsorrynotsorry
I didn't follow it, but it gave me the impression considering the small codebase and time spent unless the sponsors are busy.


[05/28/2024 05:48] 0xsorrynotsorry
This should be the case


[05/28/2024 05:54] 0xumarkhatab
yeah


[05/29/2024 10:49] vikqaz
immensely awaited for results

[05/31/2024 07:26] vikqaz
whats going on with judging?


[06/01/2024 06:32] 0xumarkhatab
+ 1


[06/01/2024 09:14] vikqaz
Compared to the sLOC, results have taken too long


[06/01/2024 10:32] bbl4de.xyz
Sloc completely doesn't matter, I don't have the SR role but if there's a lot of submissions and escalations it's not really the judge's fault.


[06/01/2024 10:51] gumgumzum
Still ongoing, didn't get to PJQA yet. Judge was handling DYAD as well, so this should go faster now since DYAD is done.


[06/01/2024 11:03] vikqaz
who said this is judge's fault?


[06/01/2024 11:04] bbl4de.xyz
Yeah sorry, I'm used to guys that are rudely showing their impatience and hating on the judges. That's not you, my bad üôå


[06/01/2024 11:05] vikqaz

showing impatience for results is natural for noobs like me. but criticising judges is unprofessional.

Damn that's crazy I expected something more like with DYAD

Whats the validation repo? Do you have a link?


[06/14/2024 02:56] shaflow_
It seems to be private and requires obtaining SR first

Hey guys,

I am posting this just to have an expert opinion if I am right or wrong.

My submission [#308](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-loop-validation/issues/308) is invalidated despite being a duplicate of below valid submission [#82](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-loop-findings/issues/82)

What am I missing guys? any help will be appreciated. Thanks.
